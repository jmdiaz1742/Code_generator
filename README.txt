mbedded systems are practically ubiquitous in this day and age, and itâ€™s hard to imagine a life without them, especially inside our homes.
A high demand for these devices has created a great competition to provide them at the best price at the right time, with the best features.
The trend in which residential products have more and more advanced features has as consequence that the embedded software inside them must be more and more complex, which leads to longer development and testing times.
As the types of advanced residential products keep diversifying, the field maintenance of all the different models that are being created grows more difficult.

To help with this problem a flexible framework for embedded systems is being proposed, which is microcontroller or microprocessor architecture independent, along with a code auto-generator for a user friendly, simple, and fast framework configuration.
This will allow to have a common software base between different projects, which shortens the learning curve, development time, and module validation.
